# Recipie App
## by Jacob Stoebel
A simple app for storing recipes using React/Redux.
Built for the freeCodeCamp.com curriculum. Meets the following user stories:

 - I can create recipes that have names and ingredients.
 - I can see an index view where the names of all the recipes are visible.
 - I can click into any of those recipes to view it.
 - I can edit these recipes.
 - I can delete these recipes.
 - All new recipes I add are saved in my browser's local storage. If I refresh the page, these recipes will still be there.
